# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository has the starter code for the project from Lighthouse Labs: As a student I forked and cloned this repository, then build upon it to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

I first build out the base functionality of displaying composing and submitting new tweets on one page. In addition, I created toggle buttons for accessing the tweet form (top right) and scrolling back to the top of the page while browsing tweets (bottom right).
